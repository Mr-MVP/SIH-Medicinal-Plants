    India, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification 
    is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the 
    market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact 
    morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and 
    similar characteristics. Moreover, the extensive consumption to meet demand-supply ratio exerts a heavy strain on the existing 
    resources. It further leads to the practice of adulteration, substitution, and disbelief in the curative capability of the system 
    eventually. Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using 
    Different Machine Learning Algorithms will be of immense use. It will be helpful at every level viz. wholesaler, distributor, etc. 
    of the supply chain of raw material being utilized in the system.</p></div>
